We are a group with more than **85 years of experience** in software projects. We help organisations solve problems, manage eternal WIP and encourage software teams to success.

* **WE WON'T** follow some dogma about how the project should be done
* **WE WON'T** fall into the hype
* **WE WON'T** fall into the last trendy framework
* **WE WON'T** put excuses
* **WE WON'T** say yes all the time to you

> If you are interested in what we can do, please check our [Virgam](/virgam.md) page. If you have a stuck software project and need help, please check our [venenata codice](/venenata_codice.md) section.
